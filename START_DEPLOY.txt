🚀 FULLY AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT
=============================

Just run this ONE command:

Windows:
  .\scripts\auto-vercel-deploy.bat

That's it! The script does EVERYTHING:
- Installs Vercel CLI
- Logs you in (one-time, opens browser)
- Deploys your app
- Reads API keys from .env.local
- Adds all environment variables
- Redeploys
- Done!

Make sure you have .env.local with your API keys first!

After first deploy, just "git push" - fully automated! 🎉
