Here’s a prompt you can paste into v0 / any AI app‑builder and then tweak. You can shorten it later, but start long and specific like this.

You are designing a web + mobile‑friendly app for deaf and hard‑of‑hearing people to follow real‑time conversations. Focus on clarity, low strain, and mobile‑first UX. I want you to propose UI structure, components, and interaction logic (no code yet).

Product concept
Build a minimal but polished v0 of:

“A live caption app that shows speech as short, readable chunks (bionic‑reading style), optimized for real conversations instead of meeting transcripts.”

The app should:

Run primarily on phones (small screens first), but look reasonable on desktop.

Show one caption chunk at a time, not a long scrolling wall of text.

Use bionic/RSV‑style emphasis (e.g., bolded mid‑letters) to make each chunk glanceable.

Support subtle speaker differentiation (color, label, or icon), but keep it simple.

Require no signup for v0: users open the app and can start captioning immediately.

Assume a backend exists that streams text chunks and speaker metadata; focus on UI and front‑end logic.

Screens and flows to design
Design the following main screens/flows in detail:

Landing / Start screen

Goal: let a new user start captioning in 1–2 taps.

Very simple layout: logo or app name, one short sentence about what it does, and a big “Start captions” button.

Secondary small link/button: “Settings” or “Preferences”.

Optional note: “No signup. Works best in quiet environments. Built for deaf and hard‑of‑hearing people.”

Describe:

Layout for mobile first (what’s at the top, middle, bottom).

Typography choices (large, high‑contrast, accessible).

Color scheme: prefer high‑contrast but not too bright; accessible palette.

Live captions screen

This is the core of the app. Design this very carefully.

Requirements:

The main UI shows one caption chunk at a time in a large area. Under it, maybe the next chunk appears briefly as a “ghost” or minimized preview.

Use bionic/RSV‑style emphasis: within each word, the first part or middle letters are bolded to help the eye lock on; but do this in a way that isn’t visually overwhelming.

Chunk size: 3–10 words per chunk (assume we can tune this later). UI should be okay if a chunk is shorter or slightly longer.

Show subtle speaker differentiation:

Could be a colored bar or dot near the chunk.

Or a small label like “Speaker 1”, “Speaker 2”, “You”.

Colors must be color‑blind friendly and not too aggressive.

Provide a simple mic state indicator:

“Listening…” vs “Paused”.

Tap or button to toggle.

Provide minimal controls:

Button to pause/resume captions.

Button to switch between “chunk mode” and “scroll mode” (full transcript), but default to chunk mode.

Optionally, a very light “history” button that opens a bottom sheet with recent chunks (no infinite scrolling needed for v0).

Describe:

Exact layout for mobile: where the main chunk appears (center), where speaker indicator lives, where pause/resume and other buttons sit (bottom bar, top bar, etc.).

Font sizes, line spacing, and background/foreground contrast to reduce eye strain in low light and bright light.

How new chunks animate in (e.g., fade/slide), and how old chunks disappear or move to history.

How to keep the screen from feeling “busy” while still providing enough context.

Settings / Preferences screen

Goal: allow small personalization without overwhelming the user.

Settings to include:

Caption text size: small, medium, large (show preview).

Theme: light / dark / high‑contrast.

Chunk length preference: short / medium / long (with a description like “short = fewer words per chunk, easier to glance”).

Speaker color options: “colorful” or “minimal” (if colorful is chosen, each speaker gets a subtle color; if minimal, just a small label).

Optional: “Show transcript history” on/off toggle.

Describe:

Layout and grouping of settings.

How to make it understandable for someone who may not be a tech‑savvy power user.

Transcript history view (basic)

Goal: show recent chunks in a simple scrollable list without ruining the main live experience.

Simple screen or bottom sheet with a vertical list of caption chunks, each with timestamp and speaker color/label.

No advanced search or export in v0; just scrolling.

Clear “Back” or “Close” action to return to live captions quickly.

Describe:

Layout and how many chunks to show by default.

How to visually separate chunks (divider, spacing).

How to keep history visually secondary to live captions in the overall UX.

Logic and interaction details (no code, just behavior)
Describe the behavior and UI logic as if you’re writing a spec for a developer:

Chunk streaming logic (front‑end)

The app receives a stream of caption chunks from a backend (each chunk includes: text, speaker_id, timestamp).

When a new chunk arrives:

It replaces the previous main chunk in the main view.

The previous chunk is moved to the history buffer.

The UI should handle brief gaps: if no new chunk arrives for a few seconds, show a subtle “Listening…” indicator and keep the last chunk visible.

Bionic/RSV emphasis logic

Explain how you want words styled in each chunk: e.g., bold first 3–4 letters of each word above 4 letters; keep shorter words normal.

Ensure that emphasized text doesn’t make the chunk too noisy; describe design rules to keep it readable.

Speaker differentiation

Each speaker_id maps to a color and/or label in the UI. For v0, assume 2–4 speakers in a conversation.

If the system cannot detect speaker reliably, fall back to “Unknown” or omit the label.

Describe how the user can understand “who is speaking” at a glance using your design.

Mobile‑first interaction

Explain tap interactions:

Tap on the main chunk does nothing (avoid accidental interruptions).

Tap on a small button to pause/resume listening.

Tap on a history icon to open transcript; swiping down closes history.

Address one‑handed use: buttons reachable by thumb on phone.

Edge cases

Describe how the UI should behave when:

The network is slow or disconnected (show a short message like “Connection issue; trying to reconnect” but keep the last chunk visible).

The microphone permission is not granted (show a simple permission explanation and a button to open system settings).

Text is long (someone talks non‑stop): break into multiple chunks gracefully instead of shrinking the font.

Visual style & accessibility
Specify a visual style optimized for accessibility:

High‑contrast text and backgrounds.

Large, legible sans‑serif font.

Avoid relying solely on color to indicate speakers (always pair color with a label or icon).

Make sure the design works both in quiet one‑on‑one settings and in darker noisy environments (e.g., restaurants, family dinners).

Now, based on everything above:

Propose a clear page structure and component list for each screen.

Describe the user journey from first visit → starting captions → adjusting settings → glancing at history.

Highlight any UX details that specifically reduce cognitive/eye strain for deaf and hard‑of‑hearing users in long conversations.
